# Structure and Union Types

## Introduction
In C, structures and unions are user-defined data types that allow the grouping of different types of variables.

## User-Defined Structure Types
A structure is defined using the `struct` keyword, which allows you to create data types that can store multiple related data items.

## Functions with Structured Results
C allows you to return structures from functions as a single entity, making it easier to manage grouped data.

## Complex Structures
Complex structures can contain other structures, allowing for nested data representation.

## Self-Referential Structures
These are structures that contain a pointer to another structure of the same type, useful for linked list implementations.

## Bit Fields
Bit fields allow you to define variables that use a specific number of bits, which is useful for memory optimization.

## Union Types
Unions allow you to store different data types in the same memory location, providing efficient memory usage.

## typedef
The `typedef` keyword helps create new names for existing data types, making code more readable.

## Enumeration
Enumerations define variables that can hold a set of predefined constants, making the code clearer and less error-prone.
